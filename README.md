# 🍰 | Advent of What?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

# 🍒 | Progress
It takes a whole day for me to solve a problem, but that's why problems are named as day-1, day-2 etc. if the avarage solving speed was an hour,
they would be named as hour-1, hour-3, hour-4... So nothing is wrong with my brain! Anyways, i'm planning to solve a problem once a week.


# 💞 | Leaderboard
Feeling competetive?? What about joining to a leaderboard, here it is `5592766-cbb1827d`! I don't think there will be too much people but i hope you'll enjoy! (๑ > ᴗ < ๑)
